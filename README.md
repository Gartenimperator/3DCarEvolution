# 3DCarEvolution
This project offers the typescript code of a Webpage, which runs a genetic algorithm represented on a SPW, that tries to improve motorisied vehicles.
This is done inside a world created by Three.js and Cannon.js.

The project was inspired by [http://boxcar2d.com](http://boxcar2d.com/). 
A development server can be started by calling
```
npx vite
```

You can build the project into a single javascript file, which also copies and maintains the paths to resources via
```
npm run buildRes
```
